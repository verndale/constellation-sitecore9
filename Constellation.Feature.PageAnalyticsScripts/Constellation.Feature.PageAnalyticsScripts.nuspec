	<summary>Sitecore Helix-style library that provides bare-essentials support for page metadata.</summary>
	<description>
VERSION 9.1 is compiled for Sitecore 9.1 use and will not work on earlier versions.
Requires Sitecore 9.1
Requires .NET 4.7.1

Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.

The Feature.PageAnalyticsScripts namespace contains controllers that will render 3rd party analytics and reporting
scripts to the page. To get the controllers and supporting Data Templates, the included Sitecore package must be installed
This should happen automatically when you build and deploy your project.

After installation, some configuration within Sitecore is required.
1. You need to select a location for Page Analytics Scripts Items.
2. For each of the Controller Renderings provided in the package, you need to set the Datasource Folder field to
the above location.
3. It is recommended that you create placeholders for the Html Header tag as well as the top and bottom of the Body
tags. You can then assign the provided Controller Renderings to those locations in the Standard Values of your most
basic Page Items.

This module isolates the analytics script kit from actual pages, so you may share scripts on multiple pages (typically
every page on a site references the same datasource). You can also "stack" scripts by adding multiple instances of the
controller renderings with different datasources.

This module does not directly support page/experience editor because:
1. Scripts are invisible
2. Their location in the HTML document may make it difficult to provide access to the rendering.

Because maintaining these scripts requires knowledge of Javascript and Marketing Technology, it is recommended that only
users familiar with the Presentation Details dialog maintain these objects.
