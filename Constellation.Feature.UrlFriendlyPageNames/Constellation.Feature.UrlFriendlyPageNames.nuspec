	<summary>Sitecore Helix-style library for transforming human-entered Item Names into SEO-friendly URL slugs.</summary>
	<description>
VERSION 9.1 is compiled for Sitecore 9.1 use and will not work on earlier versions.
Requires Sitecore 9.1
Requires .NET 4.7.1

Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.

This small Feature contains a Sitecore Rule Action which must be installed in order to take advantage
of this library. The package should self-install once you build and deploy your project.

To use, an Item Saved rule must be created. The rule must have a condition that specifies that an Item is a "page" and therefore
needs an SEO-friendly URL. The rule action should be the one included in this kit. Rule options include:
- Replace Diacritics
- Clear Display Name (recommended so that marketers see the actual Item name and therefore URL slug for pages)
- Specify illegal characters to remove (Regex "\s" is a good choice.)
- Replace spaces or remove spaces from names
- Force lowercase

It is up to the implementer to determine the nature of "page" Items. We recommend looking at Constellation.Foundation.Datasources for
rule conditions that are suitable for this specific task.

Note that the Illegal Characters option and the Replace Spaces option can conflict, a "-" will be removed if you use the "\W" regex,
resulting in behavior similar to "Remove Spaces" We strongly recommend using "\s".
